    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A website is trying to increase registration for first-time visitors, exposing a random subset of these visitors to a new site design. Of 752 randomly sampled visitors over a month who saw the new design, 64 registered. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the percentage of visitors who would register for the website under the new design using the normal distribution. Save your answer in a tuple `q1_1` with 2 `numpy.float64` items that `q1_1[0]` is the left bound and `q1_1[1]` is the right bound. Use percentages for both bounds, for example, save 50.0 in your answer for 50% of visitors.\n",
    "2. A study examined the average pay for a random sample of men and women entering the workforce as doctors for 21 different positions. If each gender was equally paid, then we would expect about half of those positions to have men paid more than women and women would be paid more than men in the other half of positions. In the study, men were, on average, paid more in 17 of the 21 positions. Complete a hypothesis test (two-sided or one-sided, just be clear which you are reporting) to examine whether there is significant evidence (at the 0.05 level) of gender discrimination in pay in these positions. Report your p-value and interpret the result. Save your p-value in `q1_2` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 1\" cell."

It consists of 2 tables: `users` has a row for every individual who has rated any movies, `movie-ratings` has a row for every rating of a particular movie by a particular user. This means users with multiple ratings are in the `movie_ratings` multiple times. The data is a random sample of all of the movie ratings made on the movielens service."

Conduct a two-sided t test using [`stats.ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) to evaluate this using the sample ratings data. Report your p-value and interpret it at a significance level of 0.05. Save your p-value in `q4_1` as a `numpy.float64` and interpret it in the \"Answer 4\" cell.\n",
