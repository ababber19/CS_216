Remove these prefixes so that the columns only contain the user ids and machine ids themselves (for example, the first row should just have `yw22` in the `System User ID` column and `Carrot` in the `System Machine ID` column. \n",
    "2. The first three rows for `System Time second`, `System Memory GB` and `System Memory MB` contain numerical data but are currently formatted as strings with redundant prefix information repeating the column label and missing data represented as the string `?` instead of the Numpy `NaN` sentinel value. Fix this so that each value in the first three columns is either a single numerical value or `NaN` (note, you should use the actual `np.NaN` sentinal value, not just the String with the characters `N`, `a`, and `N`). For example, when you are done, the first three columns of the first row should all have `NaN` values, the second row should be `40`, `3`, and `382`, and so on. Note that the rows at index `400` and on have System Time recorded in minutes instead of seconds, be sure to convert these to seconds by mulitplying by 60.\n",
    "3. Currently the System Memory is split accross two columns, one for the GB and one for the MB. For example, the total memory of the first program is 3 GB and 414 MB. Instead, represent the full system memory in the `System Memory GB` column, and get rid of the `System Memory MB` column. To do so, you need to convert the values in the MB column to GB (1 MB is 0.001 GB) and add that to the GB column, then use the [`drop` method](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.drop.html). Missing values should remain missing after this transformation.\n",
