    "Below we import two data sets `university_data` both with and without NAs in the `cost_after_aid` column. The first dataset contains information about 311 universities in the United States. In general, private universities charge higher tuition rates than public universities. However, private universities often argue that once you take financial aid into account, the cost is often not different. In this question you will explore this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, report the average `tuition` of `public` schools and the average `tuition` of `private` schools to confirm the basic notion that `private` schools charge higher tuition on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider the null hypothesis that `private` and `public` universities have the same average `cost_after_aid`. Conduct a two-sided t-test to determine whether the dataset provides statistically significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis that they have different average `cost_after_aid`. You will notice that some universities do not have a value recorded for `cost_after_aid`. For now, use `uni_caa_no_na` instead for your analysis and assume that the remaining are a random sample of American universities. Report the resulting p-value. Interpret your results at a significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the previous step you tested for statistical significance of the difference in `cost_after_aid` between public and private schools. What is the effect size? Report the average `cost_after_aid` of `public` schools and the average `cost_after_aid` of `private` schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In step 2 we assumed that we could omit the universities with missing data and the remainder would be a random sample of American universities. Is that assumption well justified? Consider especially the average values you computed in steps 1 and 3 and consider which universities are missing the `cost_after_aid` information. Given this, what can you say about the claim that \"private universities often argue that once you take financial aid into account, the cost is often not different?\"\n",
